<h1>Research Methods CA2 - Blog</h1>
<h1>Datacenter Disaster Recovery Systems and Procedures</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For my fourth-year project I have decided to do a technical review on the disaster recovery systems and procedures within datacentres. Throughout this project I will analyse the many different technologies and methods involved within disaster recovery systems in datacentres, the project will also provide an in-depth explanation of how these disaster recovery systems are implemented within datacentres .Through authentic articles and documents I aim to provide an informative document that provides readers with a cohesive review of many different technologies within disaster recovery in datacentres.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">What is Disaster Recovery?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Disaster recovery within any organisation or business is its ability to recover and respond to events that affect the operations of the organisation, within a Datacenter the disaster recovery plan and systems are even more important as datacentres are designed to provide constant service. If this service, the Datacenter encounters interruptions, or outages it will lead to significant losses not only for the operators of the datacentres but also the potentially thousands of businesses which rely on the servers within the Datacenter. Disaster recovery is achieved in datacentres through systems that prevent downtime, these systems can involve having a disaster recovery plan which details what procedures must be taken in a disaster event such as what data is replicated to an off-site facility.</p>
<h1>Why Disaster Recovery?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When researching various for different topics to do my fourth-year project on I was frequently encountering many articles and documents regarding disaster recovery, since I had found this topic interesting in second year, I continued to research the area of disaster recovery in relation to businesses. Due to our course being focused on Datacenter operations and datacentres being constantly prevalent in Irish news due to restrictions of their construction I felt that providing a detailed review of the many technologies involved with keeping a Datacenter running would be a relevant informative piece for many readers that may have only heard about datacentres recently. When continuing to research datacentres and their disaster recovery methods I encountered astonishing statistics about disaster recovery and the cost of downtime within datacentres, one of which was the cost of a single minute of downtime for a Datacenter on average was &nbsp;$5,600 (<em>Understanding the Cost of Data Center Downtime - Sunbird DCIM</em>, n.d.). With figures like the one mentioned above I felt this area of disaster recovery would definitely surprise and inform all readers ; this area of datacentres is rarely discussed which Is why I feel more should be aware of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Progression</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently for my project I have achieved several milestones, the first of which was the table of contents that includes the planned topics I will explore throughout the document although this does not yet include sub-headings which may be added during the project as I may encounter new areas I want to explore in my project. Another part of the project I have completed is the abstract, this provides a brief introduction for the literature review I am currently writing. The Literature review will provide an insight to what the project will achieve and contains surface layer explanations of each major topic within the project, this is aimed to grab the reader&rsquo;s attention and hopefully lead to interest for the final project. The literature review has allowed me to continue research into the area of disaster recovery in datacentres and further gain additional insight, the research I have completed for this part of my project will prove to be vital when analysing certain topics within my project as some of the research provides real world data &nbsp;which will assist in providing a deep explanation of key terms and technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the literature review, I will begin the main body of my project and this will involve thorough research into the many different aspects of disaster recovery within datacentres, this I were my previously done research completed for the literature review will, be useful. The main body will contain many different topics regarding disaster recovery, these may include methods such as DRAAS or memory replication techniques. Other topics which will be explored in the project are the many routing protocols used in datacentres which improve disaster recovery such as TCP and UDP as well as the various overlay technologies which are used. Another vital area I will explore within the project is the adverse effects of not investing effectively in disaster recovery, one such example which will be used to illustrate the importance of disaster recovery is the recent outage for AWS in early December. The outage in December not only effected an abundance of amazon affiliated businesses but also many other services such as ticket master, this outage led to a huge delay for the release of Adele&rsquo;s latest concerts and potentially cost the company thousands of dollars in revenue(<em>Amazon Web Services Outage Hits Apps like Ring and Ticketmaster</em>, n.d.) . Events like the one mentioned above are the kind that I feel readers will definitely resonate with , through the use of relevant content which allow readers to relate to the topic of disaster recovery more easily I feel I can effectively provide an informative project surrounding the topic of datacentres.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After completing the main body of my project, I will then begin the conclusion to the project, this conclusion will aim to provide readers with a comprehensive summary of the project&rsquo;s major topics. There are several challenges ahead which I feel I will need to overcome throughout the project.&nbsp; The first of these challenges would be time management , throughout the semester I felt managing time to achieve certain project milestones was difficult although towards the end of the semester I have began to effectively manage my time through planning. The final challenge is the sheer amount of research involved in the project, previously I have struggled to maintain the many sources and articles used in projects, but now I can organise and use these resources more effectively thanks to greater experience when writing.</p>
